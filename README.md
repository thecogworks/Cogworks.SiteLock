## How it works

SiteLock is simply a module which is loaded dymically at runtime. It inspects the domain of each request, and then either allows it, or throws a HttpException with a status code of 403.
	
## Usage

After installing the package, you'll be able to lock any website via /config/SiteLock.config.

### Locked Domains

This section of the configuration specifies specific domains to be locked in the Umbraco instance.

Example:
~~~xml
<lockedDomains>
    <domain>localhost</domain>
    <domain>staging.sitelock.local</domain>
</lockedDomains>
~~~

To lock all domains, simply use *.
Example:
~~~xml
<lockedDomains>
    <domain>*</domain>
</lockedDomains>
~~~

### Allowed Paths

This section of the configuration allows you to specify paths which can be allowed. 

Example:
~~~xml
<allowedPaths>
	<path>^/news(.*)</path>
	<path>/403.html</path>
</allowedPaths>
~~~

#### Important  

Note that the paths are actually regular expressions. So in the example above, we allow paths which "start with" /news/. 


### Allowed IPs

This section of the configuration allows you to specify IPs which can be allowed. 

Example:
~~~xml
<allowedIps>
	<ip>127.0.0.1</ip>
</allowedIps>
~~~
  
Changes to /config/SiteLock.config will require an application restart, as the config file cached at startup.   
	
### Integration

SiteLock was designed to be simple for developers. Just install via nuget or the Umbraco backoffice. Configure /config/SiteLock.config and you're good to go.
